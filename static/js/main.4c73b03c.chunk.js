The goal is simple: make a better subway layout. Both Francis (co-contributor to Moment's Notice) and I will be trying to tackle this issue (each from a different angle). Personally, I hope to utilize machine learning to generate new maps (whereas Francis will be using a more purely mathematical approach). In this installment, I hope to outline the general methodology through which I will be approaching the problem.

For example, if we represent our subway graphically by assigning a vertex to each station, both a complete graph and minimum spanning tree could be argued to be an optimally efficient layout. This is because there are various aspects of a transport network that can determine efficiency with some of these factors being at odds with one another. With that in mind, let's look at efficiency a bit more closely."),i.a.createElement(_,null,"As far as I'm concerned, there are three primary factors of importance when it comes to efficiency for our subway network: distance, commuter time, and service potential (which I'll explain)."),i.a.createElement(_,null,"Distance is obviously important because it wouldn't be feasible to build and maintain lines to and from every station in a system (unless there are like, four stations in total).

The lower the service potential, the more distance-optimized that station will be.'),i.a.createElement(_,null,"Assigning a metro system an efficiency ultimately comes down to relating these three values (distance, commuter time, and service potential) in a reasonable, quantifiable, consistent, and repeatable way.

Essentially, each graph will be composed of multiple "chains," so to speak. Each chain will represent an individual subway line with each vertex in each chain representing a certain station. The edge connecting any two vertices in a chain will be weighted according to the real-life euclidean distance between the two stations represented by those vertices plus some intermediate node penalty (INP). If the same station is in two or more chains, those chains will be connected at the shared station via a transfer edge.

First, by using a station\'s traffic as its service potential, we can ensure that "more important" stations are more commuter time\u2013optimized and are more prioritized while the "less important" stations are more distance-optimized and are less prioritized. This is because by weighting INPs and NTPs by service potential, a high service potential would result in the incentivization of visiting fewer stops and making fewer transfers. Additionally, by weighting our sum by service potential, minimizing our weighted sum for "more important" stations will matter more (which makes sense). The opposite applies for stations with low service potential. Also, the reason our abstracted chain representation even works to begin with is because a) if you imagine that our INPs and NTPs in the figure above (which visualizes our graphical representation) were of length 0, our chain model would resemble its real-life counterpart and b) if you think about it, the reason it\'s annoying to have lots of stops or transfers is because in that time, you could otherwise be travelling toward your destination meaning that having a stop or transfer is like having to travel extra distance which is why it makes sense to utilize INPs and NTPs at all. Finally, the reason we average our weighted sum at the end instead of something analogous such as summing our sums is because even though this would/should have a virtually identical effect on our machine learning algorithm, by averaging our sums, I\'d assume that we\'d have more normalized (and therefore comparable) values across multiple different subway systems.'),i.a.createElement(_,null,"One major problem is it's difficult to analyze the actual importance of certain routes.

With Seoul having one of the best metro systems in the world, I'd assume that a similar statement could be said about almost every other metro system in the world.

To do this, I hope to train a machine learning algorithm to minimize an inefficiency metric that accounts for distance, commuter time, and service potential. Although there are certain drawbacks to the method proposed, it should still work relatively well (admittedly, this statement is backed by intuition rather than data).
