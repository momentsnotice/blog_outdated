The edge connecting any two vertices in a chain will be weighted according to the real-life euclidean distance between the two stations represented by those vertices plus some intermediate node penalty (INP). If the same station is in two or more chains, those chains will be connected at the shared station via a transfer edge.

This is because by weighting INPs and NTPs by service potential, a high service potential would result in the incentivization of visiting fewer stops and making fewer transfers. Additionally, by weighting our sum by service potential, minimizing our weighted sum for "more important" stations will matter more (which makes sense). The opposite applies for stations with low service potential. Also, the reason our abstracted chain representation even works to begin with is because a) if you imagine that our INPs and NTPs in the figure above (which visualizes our graphical representation) were of length 0, our chain model would resemble its real-life counterpart and b) if you think about it, the reason it\'s annoying to have lots of stops or transfers is because in that time, you could otherwise be travelling toward your destination meaning that having a stop or transfer is like having to travel extra distance which is why it makes sense to utilize INPs and NTPs at all. Finally, the reason we average our weighted sum at the end instead of something analogous such as summing our sums is because even though this would/should have a virtually identical effect on our machine learning algorithm, by averaging our sums, I\'d assume that we\'d have more normalized (and therefore comparable) values across multiple different subway systems.'),i.a.createElement(G,null,"One major problem is it's difficult to analyze the actual importance of certain routes.

What may initially seem like a glaring oversight is that there is absolutely no input data regarding the actual coordinates of the stations; however, this isn\'t necessary.

Furthermore, based on cursory tests, python (and/or my computer itself) seemed to be computationally overloaded when trying to generate a network that could take 188,359 inputs. Furthermore, for the output, the network has to choose which node to travel to next, so it would have to have 434 + 1 (with the +1 representing the boolean switch for moving to the next line) or 435 outputs. Not only would such a massive network be difficult to generate, but it would be even harder to fire the network and breed/mutate it.

First, although INP and NTP fluctuate with station service potential, there has to be some base INP and base NTP value to scale. There were a few steps involved in determining these base values (and as a fair warning, I completely ignoring sig figs). Based on cursory research, the average subway car operates at 50 kmph. If I assume that each intermediate station slows down a trip between stations a and b by 40 seconds and that each transfer slows down the same trip by 3 minutes, that means that using our 50 kmph value, a reasonable base INP should be equivalent to 0.6 km and that a reasonable base NTP should be equivalent to 2.5 km. However, with the test stations being imaginary, when they had coordinates initialized in the range [0, 1], there was no context for the scale of the map. This means that we can't just have an INP of 0.6 and NTP of 2.5 because 1 unit in our map isn't equivalent to 1 km. To solve this, I (somewhat boldly) assumed that each station serviced a similarly sized area on average. Assuming that the distance covered by the initialization range of 0 to 1 along either the horizontal or vertical axis is equal to some distance ",i.a.createElement("i",null,"u"),", the total area of the map would equal to ",i.a.createElement("i",null,"u",i.a.createElement("sup",null,"2")),".

In the Seoul Metro, it takes an average of ~2.5 minutes to get from one station to its neighbor.

Setting ",i.a.createElement("i",null,"(u/(10**0.5)) + (u/(5**0.5))/2")," equal to 2.08 km, we can see that u is ~ 5.5 km. Therefore, our INP and NTP get scaled accordingly resulting in an INP of 0.1 and NTP of 0.45. Maybe it doesn't make sense to use the value of 2.5 minutes between neighboring stations (and therefore 0.1 for our INP and 0.45 for our NTP) because our test metro might not have the same density as Seoul's metro.
