Essentially, each graph will be composed of multiple "chains". Each chain will represent an individual subway line. Each vertex in each chain will represent a certain station. The edge connecting any two vertices in a chain  will be weighted according to the real-life euclidean distance between the two stations the vertices represent plus some intermediate node penalty (INP). If the same station is in two or more chains, it will be connected to each of its counterparts via a transfer edge.

First, by using a station\'s traffic as its service potential, we can ensure that "more important" stations are more commuter time\u2013optimized and are more prioritized while the "less important" stations are more distance-optimized and are less prioritized. This is because by weighting INPs and NTPs by service potential, a high service potential would result in the incentivization of visiting fewer stops and making fewer transfers. Additionally, by weighting our sum by service potential, minimizing our weighted sum for "more important" stations will matter more (which makes sense). The opposite applies for stations with low service potential. Also, the reason our abstracted chain representation even works to begin with is because a) if you imagine that our INPs and NTPs in the figure above were of length 0, our chain model would resemble its real-life counterpart and b) if you think about it, the reason it\'s annoying to have lots of stops or transfers is because in that time, you could otherwise be travelling toward your destination meaning that having a stop or transfer is like having to travel extra distance which is why it makes sense to utilize INPs and NTPs at all. Finally, the reason we average our weighted sum at the end instead of something analogous such as summing our sums is because even though this would have a virtually identical result for our algorithm, by averaging our sums, it could give us a more normalized value across different subway systems (not just Seoul\'s).'),i.a.createElement(J,null,"One major problem is it's difficult to analyze the actual importance of certain routes. For example, even though some station, A, and another station, B, might both draw heavy traffic, this doesn't necessitate heavy traffic between A and B. A and B could be two hubs, so to speak, each with their own relatively contained subsystems. Unfortunately, since it's difficult to find data about the importance of actual routes themselves (unless we were to track people individually as they move around in a subway), the next best thing, if you ask me, is to just use station importance based on general traffic."),i.a.createElement(J,null,"To summarize, the metric we're using is far from perfect, but its hard to make a perfect metric (and get data required for a perfect metric).
