The edge connecting any two vertices in a chain will be weighted according to the real-life euclidean distance between the two stations represented by those vertices plus some intermediate node penalty (INP). If the same station is in two or more chains, those chains will be connected at the shared station via a transfer edge.

First, by using a station\'s traffic as its service potential, we can ensure that "more important" stations are more commuter time\u2013optimized and are more prioritized while the "less important" stations are more distance-optimized and are less prioritized. This is because by weighting INPs and NTPs by service potential, a high service potential would result in the incentivization of visiting fewer stops and making fewer transfers. Additionally, by weighting our sum by service potential, minimizing our weighted sum for "more important" stations will matter more (which makes sense). The opposite applies for stations with low service potential. Also, the reason our abstracted chain representation even works to begin with is because a) if you imagine that our INPs and NTPs in the figure above (which visualizes our graphical representation) were of length 0, our chain model would resemble its real-life counterpart and b) if you think about it, the reason it\'s annoying to have lots of stops or transfers is because in that time, you could otherwise be travelling toward your destination meaning that having a stop or transfer is like having to travel extra distance which is why it makes sense to utilize INPs and NTPs at all. Finally, the reason we average our weighted sum at the end instead of something analogous such as summing our sums is because even though this would/should have a virtually identical effect on our machine learning algorithm, by averaging our sums, I\'d assume that we\'d have more normalized (and therefore comparable) values across multiple different subway systems.'),i.a.createElement(U,null,"One major problem is it's difficult to analyze the actual importance of certain routes.

In other words, the higher the algebraic connectivity, the harder it is for break or cut the network into discrete pieces. Yet, this value is not very sensitive when applied to complex networks. Though extremely useful, some studies have referred to it as rather \u201ccoarse\u201d and \u201cbinary\u201d when analyzing complex networks (Jun et al. 2010).

It is much more sensitive to singular node attacks and is useful for expressing robustness in terms of alternate routings and pathways.

The last metric I want to introduce is assortativity. Though largely contrived and determined, experimentation (Ishikura et. al 2016) showed that assortativity values ranging from [-0.67, 0.58] lowered hop count and provided further \u201cefficiency\u201d enhancing benefits to a single network (I\u2019ll for sure have to generate metro networks and analytically determine the associativity bounds myself later). To allow for some standardization, I had to choose whether our metric with reward assortativity, or its contrapositive, dissassortivity. It turns out that dissassortivity generally increases robustness and leads to poor network efficiency.
