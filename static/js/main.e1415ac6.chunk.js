But how exactly could one go about improving the metro's efficiency?"),i.a.createElement(J,null,"First and foremost, there is no concrete definition of what makes a system like a subway efficient. For example, if we represent our subway graphically by creating a vertex for each station, both a complete graph and minimum spanning tree could be argued to be an optimally efficient layout.

With that in mind, let's continue."),i.a.createElement(J,null,"As far as our definition of efficiency is concerned, there are three primary factors of importance: distance, commuter time, and service potential (which I'll explain)."),i.a.createElement(J,null,"Distance is obviously important because it wouldn't be feasible to build and maintain lines to and from every station in a system (unless there are like, four stations in total).

Essentially, each graph will be composed of multiple "chains". Each chain will represent an individual subway line. Each vertex in each chain will represent a certain station.

If the same station is in two or more chains, it will be connected to each of its counterparts via a transfer edge.

First of all, in the example provided above, it\'s easy to see how if all the vertices labeled "2" (the only transfer station depicted) were collapsed and combined our chain model would resemble its real-life counterpart. If the NTPs and INPs had weights of 0, our new chain model would result in a distance-optimized graph (and we\'d have a minimum spanning tree). Likewise, if you imagine that the INPs and NTPs were far larger, it would make the extra edge weight drawn from real-life distance trivial thereby making it more important to avoid any stops/transfers than anything else leading to a commuter time\u2013optimized graph (and we\'d have a complete graph). Finally, thinking back to earlier, "the higher the service potential, the more time-optimized that station will be. The lower the service potential, the more distance-optimized that station will be."

Imagine if station service potentials were'),i.a.createElement(J,null,"There are a few alterations that can be made to this formula that might work better depending on the case. For instance, rather than averaging our weighted sums at the end, the sums can, themselves, be summed. To be completely honest, I don't really know which method would actually end up working better and maybe they'd both be essentially identical in effectiveness. Conceptually, there shouldn't really be much of a difference between if an average or summation is used; however, we will go with an average because an average should theoretically give a relatively normalized value across subways with different amounts of stations (at least when compared to a sum)."),i.a.createElement(J,null,"Additionally, one major problem is it's difficult to analyze the actual importance of certain routes. For example, even though some station, A, and another station, B, might both draw heavy traffic, this doesn't necessitate heavy traffic between A and B.
